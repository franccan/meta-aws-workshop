Developing a project that use embedded devices requires engineering effort for selecting the right Operating System, building Board Support Package extensions and actually developing the application. In this module we tackle the first one. Choosing the right OS is a critical step in the path to production as it is, after all, the beating heart of your device: it needs to be secure, resilient, updateable, maintainable and may need to be compatible with different hardware architectures. 

The Yocto Project is an open source collaboration project that helps developers create custom Linux-based systems by providing flexible set of tools and a space where embedded developers can share technologies, software stack configurations, and best practices that can be used to create tailored Linux images based on your project needs. In this module, you’ll learn what the process is of creating an embedded OS image using the Yocto Project in the Cloud
