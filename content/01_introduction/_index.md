In this section, you will learn how CI/CD fits into the iot product life cycle and the roles participating at each phase during the iot product life cycle. The introduction roughly mirrors the first module in the original training.  The introduction has three sections:
- High level overview of the iot product life cycle visualized by a SIPOC diagram
- High level overview of role-based deliverables across the life cycle visualized by a lightweight flowchart categorized by roles
- A workshop roadmap that draws parallels between the iot product life  cycle the each module in the workshop, visualized by an execution architecture.
